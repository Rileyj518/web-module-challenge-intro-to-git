## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?While Git is a tool that's used to manage multiple versions of source code edits that are then transferred to files in a Git repository, GitHub serves as a location for uploading copies of a Git repository. git bash 
3. Why do we create a branch? if you want to create a new feature or fix a bug
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? to have the URL to submit on canvas 
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. git switch 
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?git fetch is a primary command used to download contents from a remote repository., Merging is Git's way of putting a forked history back together again. The git pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content.
7. What is a merge conflict?A merge conflict is an event that takes place when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits.
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?The easiest way to resolve a conflicted file is to open it and make any necessary changes.
After editing the file, we can use the git add a command to stage the new merged content.
The final step is to create a new commit with the help of the git commit command
